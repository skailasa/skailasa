### Hey! ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m Computational Science PhD Student at University College London, currently focussed on [PyExaFMM](https://github.com/exafmm/pyexafmm) - a new library for Fast Multipole Methods.
- ðŸš€  Iâ€™m interested in parallel and distributed programming, and emergent software engineering paradigms for new architectures.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with anyone else interested in this stuff, especially applied to __fast__ numerical algorithms.
