### Hey! 👋

- 🔭 I’m Computational Science PhD Student at University College London, currently focussed on [PyExaFMM](https://github.com/exafmm/pyexafmm) - a new library for Fast Multipole Methods.
- 🌱 I’m interested in parallel and distributed programming, and emergent software engineering paradigms for new architectures.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate with anyone else interested in this stuff, especially applied to __fast__ numerical algorithms. 
- 💬 Ask me about maths/cs/physics, my emails are open 🙂.
