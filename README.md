I’m Computational Mathematics PhD Student at University College London, currently focussed on [PyExaFMM](https://github.com/exafmm/pyexafmm) - a new library for Fast Multipole Methods. I’m interested in parallel and distributed programming, and emergent software engineering paradigms for new architectures.
