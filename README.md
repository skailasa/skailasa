I’m Computational Mathematics PhD Student at University College London, currently focussed on:

- [PyExaFMM](https://github.com/exafmm/pyexafmm) - a Python library for Fast Multipole Methods.
- [AdaptOctree](https://github.com/Excalibur-SLE/AdaptOctree) - a Python library for building & balancing linear Octrees

I’m interested in parallel and distributed computing, emerging software engineering paradigms for new architectures, and heterogenous compute environments.
